table holding config options and what message changes them

messageId, guildId, optionName (maybe enum??? seems hard to do. Can we extend
enums like classes? in that case we could have a base enum in the db file and
then extensions in the cogs.), cogName (enum), option value. Maybe have an
option type in there too?


can hold settings for both the drinks_handler, and role_handler sort of things.

drinks_handler has drink types for example where no data needs to be stored

role handler could potentially do the same thing, but could also store data
straight in the db... That would be wrong though, and Dag wouldn't like it...


should probably probably hold config messages for proper db design....



when creating a new config entry it should
1. Check if there already exists an entry for the given server
2. If yes, send a link to that message and warn that it will be removed. Also
show a dropdown for a new selection of channels.
3. If no then just show a dropdown of channels to select for setting channel.


for the drinks options, have a command to change it. Have it show a list of all
current options and then have an add and delete button at the bottom. Add gives
a popup where you can put in a new name, whilst remove gives you a dropdown
where you can select one or multiple to remove.


For the actual role sync itself we want to keep track of all unsynced roles and
who has them. When it's time to sync we simply overwrite the user's role with
our own custom list.
