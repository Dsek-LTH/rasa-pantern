table holding config options and what message changes them

messageId, guildId, optionName (maybe enum??? seems hard to do. Can we extend enums like classes? in that case we could have a base enum in the db file and then extensions in the cogs.),
cogName (enum), option value. 
Maybe have an option type in there too?


can hold settings for both the drinks_handler, and role_handler sort of things.

drinks_handler has drink types for example where no data needs to be stored

role handler could potentially do the same thing, but could also store data straight in the db... That would be wrong though, and Dag wouldn't like it...


should probably pmly hold config messages for proper db design....
