We have functions in the database for handling all our role configs.

Get a list of all users that have connected accounts from Janus (or discord, and then get their stil-id via Janus).
Make a list of all roles that **aren't** going to be synced
Save who has what un-synceable roles somewhere (prob to disk ngl, seems dangerous to do in memory if shit crashes).
Get all roles for all users from authentic and put them in a dict or something, mapping the user to their roles.
Replace the authentic ids with discord role ids
Start overwriting roles for users one by one going by the dict
